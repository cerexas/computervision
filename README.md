- [ImageNet](https://image-net.org/): This is a large database of annotated images, and it's often used in image recognition and object detection tasks.
- [COCO (Common Objects in Context)](https://cocodataset.org/): This is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset.
- [Open Images](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html): It's a dataset from Google that is also used for object detection, visual relationship detection, and instance segmentation.
- [MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset): This database contains a large set of handwritten digits that are commonly used for training various image processing systems.
- [Fashion MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist): This is a dataset of Zalando's article images, with 28x28 grayscale images of 70,000 fashion products from 10 categories, and 7,000 images per category. The dataset is intended to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms, as it shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.
- [CelebA (CelebFaces Attributes Dataset)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset): This is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200,000 celebrity images, each with 40 attribute labels.
